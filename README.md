# FLAG
This is the version 1.0 code of the work :  
  'FLAG: Faster Learning on Anchor Graph with Label Predictor Optimization'
Of note, we use the FLANN package for approximate nearest neighbors searching. You can see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/#download and find its implementing detials.
